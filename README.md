## Overview / How to run

1. Edit the name of your bot and add the access token in the properties file
   bot/src/main/resources/application.properties
2. Read the rules and familiarize yourself with the game

3. Create your bots logic by implementing the bot interface in your own class
4. Start your bot by running the 

This module contains the logic of how bots should connect to the backend game server and play "Tablut".
By using different Spring Profiles, you can switch between different implementations of the bots "brain".

1. Create a tournament in the frontend by clicking on "Tournaments" and then "Create Tournament".
